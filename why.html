					About the Group
				</div>

				<div class="whytext">
					Ten or more writers and musicians meet at one location to write and record an entire album in one weekend. Money from our downloads goes to <a class="generallinks" target="_new" href="https://www.sweetrelief.org/">The Sweet Relief Musicians Fund.</a> Please spread the word.
				</div>
				<div class="whytext">

					We have a charter describing the rules of the "game" and four successful weekends of recording under our belt. Otherwise, it is like it sounds: We begin writing on a Friday night, and emerge, bleary-eyed and full of pride on Sunday -- with a complete, recorded album.

				</div>
				<div class="whytext">
					The players involved in 29HMP so far are from a list of bands the length of your torso, plus institutions as diverse as the touring production of Rain: A Tribute to the Beatles, New York Choral Society, Maracatu New York, and the Willie Mae Rock Camp for girls.
				</div>
				<div class="whytext">
					We grew out of the Brian Eno tribute project known as <a href="http://www.facebook.com/enoherecomethewarmjets" class="whylinks" target="_new">Here Come The Warm Jets Live.</a> The first 29 Hour Music People album is an attempt to create a lost, imaginary 1970s Brian Eno pop album.

					Press Release, Volume II: Summer Music
				</div>
				<div class="whytext">
					"One of my mottoes is that if you want to get unusual results, work fast and work cheap, because there's more of a chance that you'll get somewhere that nobody else did." -- Brian Eno
				</div>
				<div class="whytext">
					"Hurry up Harry, come on!" -- Sham 69
				</div>
				<div class="whytext">
					"Volume II: Summer Music" is the second album by 29 Hour Music People, a group of creatively restless New Yorkers whose mission is to write and record complete albums from scratch in a weekend.
				</div>
				<div class="whytext">
					The loose collective of 12 people, who have logged time in a wide variety of bands, collectively brainstorms lyrics on Friday, writes and records music on Saturday, sings direct to tape, no AutoTune, on Sunday, and returns to normal life with their other bands on Monday, before anyone notices they have been missing.
				</div>
				<div class="whytext">
					"Volume II: SUMMER MUSIC" arrives just four months after "Volume I: SOFT ENO BLESSING," whose collaborative creation in a span of 29 hours (not including sleep and meals) gave the group its name. This time, it took 31 hours to make an album happen, but it contains one more song than its predecessor, so the group decided to call it even.				</div>
				<div class="whytext">

					All proceeds from sales of the album, to be released July 16, will go to the Sweet Relief Musicians Fund, which pays the medical bills of working musicians. The album will be available as a "pay what you want" download from Bandcamp (29hourmusicpeople.bandcamp.com).
				</div>
				<div class="whytext">
					"Contemporary records are way too over-thought," says bandleader Rob Christiansen. "A creative project made quickly isn't just AS GOOD as most records; it's often BETTER than most records."
				</div>
				<div class="whytext">
					29 Hour Music People operates under a charter that governs the speed and process of recording, from passing lyrics around on notepads and iPads on Friday evening to singing harmonies through a single microphone on Sunday.
				</div>
				<div class="whytext">
					The group begins each weekend with a theme; this time the goal was to make "summer music," with each player free to decide what that means. The songs that resulted range from a woman's search for love amid the "Coney Island Trash," to a percussive meditation on the dreaded "Summer Cold," to a shambling rock report on the life and preferences of a grumpy crustacean.
				</div>
				<div class="whytext">
					Christiansen, a musician and producer whose bands have included Eggs, Grenadine and Here Come the Warm Jets LIVE, recorded "VOLUME II" with Alan Black, Alan Blattberg, Kate Edmundson, Matty Karas, Cheri Leone, Chris McBurney, Dave Satkowski and Meave Shelton and Pam Weis. Their bands and day jobs include the Trouble Dolls, Lightning Kites, Maracatu New York, Team Spider and The touring production of "Rain: A Tribute to the Beatles."
				</div>
				<div class="whytext">
					According to Christiansen, "The collaborations and juxtapositions made possible by this group of players from all disciplines is such a welcome surprise. We are playing over each other's traditions in ways that you wouldn't plan -- these things have to happen by accident."
				</div>
				<div class="whytext">
					Ever restless and ever expanding, a slightly larger group of 29 Hour Music People gathered in New York in July, 2013 to write and record "Volume III," whose theme will be "transportation."
				</div>
				<div class="whytext">
					"Volume IV" can't be far behind.
